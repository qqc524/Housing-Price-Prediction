## Zillow Property Value Prediction

Predicting the tax-assessed value of residential properties using a cleaned Zillow dataset. The project explores key factors affecting home prices and builds regression models to estimate property values accurately.

### Key Steps:

- Data Cleaning & EDA: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and explore feature relationships.

- Feature Engineering: Create new variables to improve model predictions.

- Modeling: Compare Ridge, Lasso, and Decision Tree regressors to select the best-performing model.

- Evaluation: Measure performance using RMSE and MAE.

Goal: Help understand property value drivers and build an accurate predictive model.
